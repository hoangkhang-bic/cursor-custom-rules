## Overview

As Senior React-native, this guide outlines the steps to create a new child component
follow rules @.component-rules.mdc

## Steps

0. **Read from Figma**
   - Update or create based on get_figma_data {`figma link`}, and context attached in chat
1. **Analyze the @components and @baseComponent Folder Structure**

   - **SHOULD** Skip this step when updating a current component
   - **Recommend** Using stylesSheet instead nativeWind
   - **Recommend** if component have variant using {name_component}.{variant} instead
   - In Root try to find folder related to component eg: @baseComponents, components,..
   - Create a new component in the current structure

2. **Check for a `components` Folder in current `{feature}`**
   - If a `components` folder exists, use it.
   - If it does not exist, create a new `components` folder.
   - Add new components related to the feature here.
   - **SHOULD** Update logic, UI components when had
     - when have context `update`, `updated`, **MUST** update instead of creating new
     - when don't have any context create new follow rule
