# New Feature Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to create a new feature, including screens, components, and store logic.

const wrapper-feature = @~/.cursor/prompt-variable/variable-constant.md
const feature-name = @~/.cursor/prompt-variable/variable-constant.md

- **MUST** follow rules @~/.cursor/project-rules.mdc

## Steps

1. **Analyze the `screens` Folder Structure**

   - Review the existing folder structure under `screens`.
   - Create a new screen based on the current structure.

2. **Create the Feature Under wrapper-feature Folder**

   - **MUST** Locate the wrapper-feature folder.
   - Inside it, create a new feature-specific folder.
   - Include an `index.tsx` file for the main component of this feature.
   - **MUST** create if need

3. **Check for a `components` Folder**

   - If a `components` folder exists, use it.
   - If it does not exist, create a new `components` folder.
   - Add new components related to the feature here.

4. **Check for a `store` Folder**

   - If a `store` folder exists, use it.
   - If it does not exist, create a new `store` folder.
   - **MUST** use sample , eg : @src/screen/communities/store/index.ts analysis for create new `index.ts` code sample
   - This will hold the state management logic for the new feature.

5. **Review Existing Store Files**

   - Search the codebase for any files with the pattern `use{feature-name}Store`.
   - Use the naming and structure as a reference for the new featureâ€™s store file.
   - Create a new file and initialize the store state with relevant keys and structure.
   - Include an `index.ts` file to initialize the store.

6. **Create an `actions` Folder**

   - Inside the feature folder, create an `actions` directory.
   - Each action should be in its own file.

7. **Create Screen layout**
   - **ALWAYS** follow @prompts/.create-layout-screen.prompt.md

## MUST

- Maintain consistency with naming conventions and folder structure.
- Follow project architecture patterns where applicable.
- Modularize logic and UI components to improve maintainability.
