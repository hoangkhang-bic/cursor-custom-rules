Goal is to generate a new React Native screen layout from figma link

## Step

1. **Analyze Figma Design**

   - **SHOULD** Review the Figma screen layout for mobile responsiveness.
   - **SHOULD** Compare the Figma aspect ratio with popular phone screen ratios found online.
   - **RECOMMEND** Separate child component if need

2. **Define Layout Section**

   - Identify and label the Header, Body, and Footer sections in the Figma design.
   - **MUST** add SafeAreaView for both Android and IOS

3. **Refactor into Memoized Components**

   - Create separate memoized components for Header, Body, and Footer if need in the same file.
   - Replace any existing PureComponent usages with memo for performance optimization.

4. **Map Design Parameters**

   - Extract design values (e.g., font sizes, colors) from Figma.
   - Check the existing codebase: - If values are already defined, reuse them.
   - If values are not defined, create new constants using appropriate names from the Figma design.

5. **Match with React Native Library Components**

   - **SHOULD** Find suitable component in `sourcesBase` first
   - **SHOULD** follow rule @base-new-component.prompt when init new custom component
   - **RECOMMEND** Identify matching layout components from a React Native UI library. -

**\*Focus only on layout examples that include background color for easier visual matching**
